TerriBot is a basic botting tool for territorial.io that adds multiple bots to your game. It uses Selenium, which consumes a lot of resources, so itâ€™s not very efficient. However, it still works. If the project reaches 25 stars, I might recode it to communicate with the game's WebSocket server instead of using Selenium windows for each client, which would significantly improve efficiency and allow users to run virtually an unlimited number of bots.
**Please Note:** Tabs are limited to 10 per if YOU'RE NOT USING PROXIES and 9 if you want to play yourself. This is tab limit set by david per ip, can't do much about it.

## Features

- Automated game joining
- Multiple bot instances
- Optional proxy support
- Customizable clan tags

## Quick Start

If you don't want to deal with Python, you can use the executable:

1. Download `setup.bat` from [Here](https://github.com/TrxrKnocks/TerriBot/blob/main/setup.bat).
2. Run it like any other program.

## Setup for Python Source

If you prefer running the Python script:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repo or download the source files.
3. Run `setup.bat` to install dependencies and start the bot.

Or do it manually:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python main.py`
